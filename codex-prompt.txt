Completely rebuild index.html from scratch. This is a full redesign. The goal: a website that looks like it belongs next to Stripe, Linear, and Vercel — dark, premium, and alive. It should scream innovation.

## DESIGN DIRECTION
- Full dark theme throughout — NO white or light gray sections. Everything is dark.
- Brand colors: Background #0A0F1A (near-black navy), Surface #111827, Cards #1A2235, Accent Red #CC2229
- Red accents should GLOW — use box-shadow and text-shadow with rgba(204,34,41,0.4) for depth
- Typography: Google Font "Inter" — bold and oversized headlines (clamp-based responsive sizing)
- Glassmorphism cards: backdrop-filter: blur(12px), semi-transparent backgrounds, subtle border rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
- Everything feels alive: scroll animations, hover effects, animated stats

## SECTIONS (in order)

### 1. NAVBAR
- Sticky, transparent that becomes solid dark on scroll (JS scroll listener)
- Logo: "Acaciasoft" text in white bold with a small red square (■) before the name
- Nav links: About, Services, Clients, Team, Contact
- CTA button: "Get in Touch" — red background, slight glow on hover
- Mobile: hamburger menu

### 2. HERO

- Animated canvas particle/network in the background (pure JS — draw dots connected by lines, slowly drifting) rendered BEHIND the text using z-index
- Eyebrow: small red uppercase label "ENERGY SOFTWARE SPECIALISTS"
